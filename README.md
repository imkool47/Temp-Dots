# 🧪 Linux Dotfiles (Temp/Test Configs)

This repository contains **temporary dotfile configurations** that I'm currently testing. It's a workspace for trying out new setups, themes, or tools before merging them into my main dotfiles.

## 🔧 Purpose

- Experiment with new configurations safely  
- Backup test configs before system updates or reinstalls  
- Sync experimental setups across devices

> ⚠️ These configs are **not final** — they’re being tested and may be unstable.

## ✅ Workflow

1. Test a new config in this repo.
2. If it works well and feels right...
3. Move it to your main dotfiles repo or system config.

## 🚫 Disclaimer

- These are personal test files — they might break things or not work out of the box.
